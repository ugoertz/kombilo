Kombilo documentation
=====================

Kombilo is a go database program. Its main purpose is to search for games
in which a given pattern or position occurs. You can also search for other
criteria (like time period, players, events).

The name 'Kombilo' is the Esperanto word for comb. It allows you to 'go
through the game records with a fine-toothed comb'.  Pronunciation: 'i' as
'ee' in see, and the stress is on the 'i'. 

Kombilo was written by Ulrich Goertz, ug@geometry.de.
