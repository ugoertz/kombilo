Icons
-----

Many of the icons are taken from the Tango icon collection, by Jones Lee.
See http://art.gnome.org/themes/icon/1150
They are published under the CreativCommons Attribution-Share alike License (CC
BY-SA 2.0), see http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/

I slightly modified some of the Tango icons (media-playback-back-K.png,
media-playback-pause-K.png, media-playback-start-K.png) and publish these
derived works under the CC BY-SA 2.0 license.


The other icons (w.gif, b.gif, wb.gif, bw.gif, 123.png, abc-l.png,
abc-u.png, tr.gif, sq.gif) are dual-licensed under the CC BY-SA 3.0 license

Board, stone images
-------------------

The images of the go board and the back and white stone were contributed by
Patrice Fontaine.


Logo
----

The u-go.net logo is (C) Ulrich Goertz; it may be freely distributed
together with the Kombilo documentation, but may not be used in other
contexts, and may not be altered.


Tooltip
-------

The code for the tooltip (in src/tooltip/tooltip.py) was contributed by
Tucker Beck as recipe 576688 to the ActiveState community under the MIT
license, see
http://code.activestate.com/recipes/576688-tooltip-for-tkinter/ and
slightly adapted for Kombilo.

Windows installer
-----------------

The Windows installer bundles several programs and libraries in addition to
Kombilo itself:

SQLite

::

  All of the deliverable code in SQLite has been dedicated to the public domain
  by the authors. All code authors, and representatives of the companies they
  work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the public
  domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe at the
  main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile,
  sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code form or as
  a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any
  means.

Most Boost libraries comply with the license below. While for some, other
licenses might apply, they are also freely distributable (and, since the Boost
source code is not included in the Kombilo installer, it is not even required
that the license be stated here). For details, see the link below.

The libkombilo library is compiled using the `MinGW <http://www.mingw.org/>`_
compiler, an exe file is produced using `py2exe <http://www.py2exe.org/>`_, the
installer is made with `InnoSetup <http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php>`_, and
the documentation is compiled by the `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_
package. `Fabric <http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.4.0/>`_ eases the deployment
process.
