Further acknowledgments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The libkombilo library is compiled using on Appveyor using the Microsoft Visual
Studio 2008 C++ compiler, an exe file is produced using `PyInstaller
<http://www.pyinstaller.org/>`_, the installer is made with `InnoSetup
<http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php>`_, and the documentation is compiled by
the `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ package. `VirtualBox
<https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_ turned out to be magnificent for simultaneously
developing on Linux and Windows.
