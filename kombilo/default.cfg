# Options marked as "editable" can be edited via the "Edit advanced options"
# menu command.  For those options, a label can be explicitly listed (# label:);
# otherwise the variable name is used.  If a tuple of values is specified, then
# only those values are accepted (-- marks an empty string).  If INT or BOOLEAN
# is specified, then only integers or boolean values, respectively, are
# accepted. Otherwise, arbitrary strings are accepted. All other comment lines
# are assembled and displayed as "help_text".
#
# With '# section: SECTION TITLE' you can start a new 'section'.
#
# The labels given as '# label:' are translated, as well as the help texts and
# section titles; the values are not translated since this would almost never
# make sense and add too much complexity.

# See below for examples.
